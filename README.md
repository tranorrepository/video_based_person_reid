# vedio-based-person-re-identification
this code was based on https://github.com/jiyanggao/Video-Person-ReID , https://github.com/rogeryang12/video_reid_pytorch and https://github.com/heykeetae/Self-Attention-GAN. 
i use the data preprosessing the lossfunction and the evaluation in https://github.com/jiyanggao/Video-Person-ReID .
and i rewrite a  new cnn model.

weighted the frame at feature aggragete phase using the proposed methord in "Quality Aware Network for Set to Set Recognition"(https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03373) 

i add self-attention part to get a robust feature representation
